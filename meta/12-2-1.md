  UK’s material footprint, or raw material consumption, captures the amount of domestic and foreign extraction of materials needed to produce the products used by households, governments and charities in the UK.
  Methodology for calculating material footprint is complex and the approach
  used can impact on the figures. This article gives the latest estimates using a method developed by the University of Leeds, updating the time series where revised data are available, and including figures for 2018. Data are presented for the UK.We previously published estimates of the
  UK’s material footprint using the Eurostat approach, using a tool which is publicly available. The Eurostat method uses coefficients, which estimate the quantity of a raw material required for a given product in a given year. In the latest version of the tool, the coefficients were
  calculated for the EU27 (the UK was excluded). It has therefore not been possible to provide updated estimates for the UK material footprint using the Eurostat approach. More details on the method, and other available methods, can be found in the article Measuring material footprint in
  the UK.
  
  <p>Material footprint per capita is calculated as raw material consumption (material footprint)/UK population.</p>
  
  <p>Material footprint per GDP is calculated as raw material consumption (material footprint)/GDP.</p>

  The choice of method used to calculate material footprint has an impact on the final estimates. In 2017, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted extensively with the University of Leeds about developing further environmentally relevant metrics for
  material use and resource efficiency, particularly in carbon terms. As a result, the University of Leeds have developed a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) approach, using a specifically derived UK MRIO database to underpin calculations.  Data follows the UN specification for this
  indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
