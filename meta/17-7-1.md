  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare
  of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD
  website</a>.</p><p>Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) are technologies that have the potential for significantly improved environmental performance relative to other technologies. ESTs are not just individual technologies. They can also be defined as total systems that include
  know-how, procedures, goods and services, and equipment, as well as organizational and managerial procedures for promoting environmental sustainability. This means that any attempt to provide an assessment of investment into ESTs on either a global or national level must incorporate ways
  to track funding flows into both hard and soft technologies.</p>
computation_calculations: >-
  <p>This is a tier II indicator, so the exact methodology is still in development. Using the UN metadata guidance on computation methods, this indicator has been constructed based on UK ODA sums (net amount) that relate to ESTs. The data source (see Source 1 tab) provides a breakdown of
  all ODA commitments. The information on project title and the corresponding long description for each entry were checked for key words and phrases relating to ESTs. The net ODA for entries that have matches for these key words in either the project or long description fields were summed
  for each reporting year.</p> <p>The key words and prases used are - low carbon, low-carbon, clean technology, environmental technology, green technology, cleantech, renewable energy, wastewater management, wastewater treatment, energy storage, energy distribution, water remediation,
  bioenergy, solar, climate friendly, geothermal, climate smart, sustainable energy, air pollution, carbon footprint, global emissions, clean energy, offshore wind, wind energy, wave energy, hydropower.</p>

  Latest ODA flows data are obtained from table “Data underlying the SID publication”, using columns "ProjectTitle" and "LongDescription" to filter and then sum the net values (see calculations information in National metadata tab). Previous data (2009 to 2016) are available from [SID for
  2017](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-2017)
