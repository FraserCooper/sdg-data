  <p><u>This indicator is formed of two sub-indicators.</u></p><p><b>Sub-indicator - Spatial extent of water related ecosystems</b>
  <p> Data is presented for open water (large lakes, rivers, estuaries and artificial waterbodies). Water body type is not yet included as a disaggregation.
  <p><b>Sub-indicator - Groundwater level </b><p>
  Data presented for percentage change to volume measurements, over time, of major groundwater
  aquifers.

  <p>Permanent water - area that is under water throughout the year</p><p>Seasonal water - area that is under water for less than 12 months a year</p><p>Ephemeral water - area that is episodically under water in different years</p><p>HydroBASINS - a series of polygon layers that depict
  watershed boundaries at a global scale. They use the Pfafstetter coding system, which allows for analysis of catchment topology. Catchments  can be broken down  into smaller sub-basins; with each subdivision, the Pfafstetter level increases. Here, a Pfafstetter level of 6 was used,
  giving us data for 38 catchments across the UK.

  <p><b>Sub-indicator - Spatial extent of water related ecosystems</b></p><p>Please see the blog <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/using-satellite-imagery-to-report-changes-to-water-bodies-for-sdg-6-6-1">Using satellite imagery to report changes to water bodies for SDG
  6.6.1</a> for more information on this indicator.</p><p>Data for water body spatial extent (km) and change in water body extent is derived from Earth Observation data (from the Landsat satellite programme. The resolution used does not pick up smaller waterbodies (including small lakes,
  rivers and streams). These data can be downloaded from the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE).</p><p>The data presented here have been constrained to official high-water mark boundaries, which helps ensure that costal water is not included in estimated. Measures therefore differ
  slightly to those on the <a href="https://www.sdg661.app/">Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer</a>, a GSWE platform for presenting data specifically for this indicator.</p><p>Persistent cloud cover can impact the quality of data collection. Anomalous years (likely due to cloud cover - 1994 to
  1998 and 2004 to 2009) have therefore been excluded from the data presented here, with the exception of the baseline. The baseline period of 2001 to 2005 includes the anomalous years 2004 and 2005. To mitigate the impact of variable cloud cover, the modal value of each pixel across the
  baseline years has been used to calculate the average spatial extent in the baseline period. Further details on the source data and mitigating the impacts of these anomalous periods is provided in the <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/quality-and-methodology-extent-
  and-change-of-surface-water-statistics">Data Science Campus Quality and Methodology document</a>.</p><p>HydroBASIN catchments are identified with numbers, however we have added descriptive names to each catchment in the dropdown menu - these are not official names. Work is in progress to
  provide interactive maps. While these are not yet available here, they can be viewed in the blog <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/using-satellite-imagery-to-report-changes-to-water-bodies-for-sdg-6-6-1">Using satellite imagery to report changes to water for SDG
  6.6.1</a>.</p><p><b>Sub-indicator - Groundwater level</b></p><p>Groundwater level data is obtained from BGS' WellMaster database, derived from 154 groundwater level monitoring stations to provide groundwater estimates for 19 of the 34 HydroBasin in the UK. HydroBASIN cathchments are
  identified with numbers, however descriptive names have been added to the dropdown menu, these are not official names.<p>The chosen five-year reference period for the analysis is 1990 to 1994. Values greater than 100% imply average groundwater levels have risen since the period 1990 to
  1994, while values less than 100% imply falling levels.<p>The data monitored by measuring authorities in each nation (EA, SEPA, NRW, DAERA) and are passed to BGS periodically. All chosen sites have monitoring frequencies of greater than one observation a month, are monitoring boreholes
  where groundwater levels are not systematically affected by abstraction and are representative of local and regional groundwater systems. <p>Raw data is quality assured by measuring authority and are expected to be accurate to less than +/- 0.01 metre for data collected since 1990. On
  receipt by BGS an additional check is made to ensure values fall within expected hydrogeologicaly plausible ranges.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
