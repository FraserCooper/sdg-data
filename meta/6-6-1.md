national_indicator_description: >-
  <p><u>This indicator is formed of two sub-indicators.</u></p><p><b>Sub-indicator - Spatial extent of water related ecosystems</b>
  <p> Data is presented for open water (large lakes, rivers, estuaries and artificial waterbodies). Water body type is not yet included as a disaggregation.
  <p><b>Sub-indicator - Groundwater level </b><p>
  Data presented for percentage change to volume measurements, over time, of major groundwater
  aquifers.

  <p>Permanent water - area that is under water throughout the year</p><p>Seasonal water - area that is under water for less than 12 months a year</p><p>Ephemeral water - area that is episodically under water in different years</p><p>HydroBASINS - a series of polygon layers that depict
  watershed boundaries at a global scale. They use the Pfafstetter coding system, which allows for analysis of catchment topology. Catchments  can be broken down  into smaller sub-basins; with each subdivision, the Pfafstetter level increases. Here, a Pfafstetter level of 6 was used,
  giving us data for 38 catchments across the UK.

  <p><b>Sub-indicator - Spatial extent of water related ecosystems</b><p>Proportion of area = (spatial extent / land area) x 100</p><p>Percent change in spatial extent from baseline = ((average spatial extent of 5 year period - average spatial extent from 2001-2005) / average spatial
  extent from 2001-2005) x 100</p><p>Code for extracting data from the Global Surface Water Explorer and aggreating water to UK boundaries and HydroBasins can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/datasciencecampus/sdg_661_analysis_and_reporting">Data Science Campus GitHub</a>

  </p>Percent change in groundwater level = ((average ground water of 5 year period - average groundwater level from 1990-1994) / average spatial extent from 1990-1994) x 100 
  </p><p> Total groundwater level average = (sum of
  percent change in groundwater level from all groundwater stations)/ total number of ground water stations * 100</p>
