CORRECTION (22/01/2020). The reporting of this indicator contained an error affecting the chart and table. Data on species found in the overseas territories were included. The data should only have included data on species found in the UK. This happened because of an error in the source data. We have removed the incorrect data and will update the indicator with the correct data as soon as possible. Correct data can be found on the [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles/GBR) in the UK Country Profile under the Species tab.
