  <h3>Maternal mortality rate</h3><p>Maternal mortality in the UK is measured as a rate per 100,000 maternities (defined as women who give birth to a live infant or a stillborn infant at 24 weeks or greater gestation), rather than as a ratio per 100,000 live births. This is in order to
  provide a closer approximation of the risk associated with pregnancy.</p><p>Maternal deaths are identified through a variety of sources by the MBRRACE-UK collaboration at the NPEU, University of Oxford. Further details of ascertainment methods, additional disaggregations, details of
  causes of death and recommendations for improving care can be found in the [MBRRACE-UK Saving Lives, Improving Mothers’ Care reports](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports).</p><h3>Maternal mortality ratio</h3><p>In order to allow international comparison, maternal mortality ratio
  (MMR) estimated for the UK using routinely reported data is included as a series. The data for MMR is originally sourced from Office for National Statistics, General Register Office for Scotland, and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.</p><p>MMR is much lower (about half)
  than the actual rates as identified through the UK CEMD, which uses multiple sources of death identification. This emphasises the importance of the additional case identification and checking undertaken by the MBRRACE-UK team to give an accurate maternal mortality estimate.</p><p>New
  figures are not reported, as, at the time of publication  there had not been a complete triennium since these ratios were calculated.</p><p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the
  global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
